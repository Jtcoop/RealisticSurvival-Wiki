## How can I download / install Realistic Survival?
To download and install Realistic Survival you can refer to [this guide here](https://github.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival/wiki/Installing-Realistic-Survival).

## Will Realistic Survival be available for Minecraft version XYZ?
Realistic Survival will only be available for versions 1.17 and onward. There are no plans for backporting to earlier versions.

## I have an error/bug with Realistic Survival
Ok, first, join our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/mMt3f4usqK) if you aren't in it already and go to any of the support channels like `#support-x`. We must determine if it is a bug, user error, or intended behaviour. Note that we **do not accept bug reports on discord, only on GitHub**. But experience has shown that 9 of 10 "bugs" result from outdated plugin versions, improper installation, or similar, so please discuss these issues with others on our discord server first so that developers can focus on confirmed bug reports.

Now, send us the following information (in the `#support-x` channel):
1. Check your console. Are there any errors? (If so, post them via https://pastebin.com/)

2. What do you intend to happen, and what is happening?

Please also refer to [this page](https://github.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival/wiki/How-to-report-bugs) for a much more in-depth guide on how to report issues.

Once you've sent us all this info, one of our staff or a community member will help you. **Do not ping any role or members**. If some time has passed (15+ mins), you may ping the helper role (`@Helper`). Being impatient and pinging roles/members (**especially staff**) may get you warned or kicked.

## Can I install Realistic Survival on a Singleplayer world?
No.<br>
Realistic Survival is a Bukkit / Spigot plugin, so it requires you to have a Bukkit-based Minecraft Server running. Creating such a Server is very easy, though. You will be able to find lots of tutorials online. If you want to enjoy Realistic Survival all on your own, set up a new Minecraft Server on your computer, install the plugin and connect to it using the address `localhost`. Without extra effort, your server won't be visible to others outside of your local network anyway.

## How does XYZ work?
If you'd like to know how an item works, please refer to [our wiki](https://github.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival/wiki).
> **Note**: The Wiki is still missing pages and is community ran! If you want to add content, please refer to [this guide](https://github.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival/wiki/Expanding-the-Wiki)

## When will the next update be released?
Updates will be released once they are ready. Please be mindful that ***one single*** person is managing and developing this entire project 
so updates and bug fixes are expected to be implemented at a slow rate. I am also busy most of the time and hold other obligations outside of Realistic Survival. As such, please do not ask for dates.

## Is Realistic Survival compatible with Plugin XYZ?
There is not a set answer for each and every plugin, but Realistic Survival will not be compatible with any plugin that heavily utilizes action bars or custom resource packs.

## Does XYZ custom mob exist?
No custom mobs, including dragons and sea serpents, are implemented currently. However, certain mobs drop custom loot.
