Weapons Galore! A whole new arsenal of weaponry made for Minecraft.<br><br>
Intended to replicate the Forge mod of the same name, the module adds weapons from that mod, expanding the vanilla arsenal with a bunch of unique weapons, including a variety of swords, polearms, blunt and ranged weapons.


Most of these weapons can be made from the seven vanilla tool materials, 
and each type of weapon has different properties that help with combat in certain situations, such as extended reach, damage bonuses, etc.

## Basic Materials
To craft any Spartan weapon, you will need to make either a handle or a pole.

<summary>Recipes</summary>

Handles can be crafted individually with a piece of string or 4 at a time using either leather or wool.<br>

The leather in the above recipe can be substituted for wool of any colour.<br>
Poles can be crafted in a similar way.<br>
