You may not know where to start.

## 1. The Flint Age
You can no longer break trees with your bare fists, so you'll have to get wood by creating flint tools. First, find some gravel. Gravel is commonly found near water sources or underwater. Dig it until you get flint. From there, left-click the flint on a stone block to break it into flint shards. Break leaves to acquire sticks, and then craft a flint knife using the flint shard and stick as shown below.<br><br>

You'll now want to craft a flint axe, but you need to acquire some plant string first. Break grass to acquire plant fibers, and craft plant string as shown below. <br><br>

Now, combine the plant string, stick, and flint shard together to craft a flint axe as shown below. You can now mine wood, and proceed with normal gameplay.<br><br>
