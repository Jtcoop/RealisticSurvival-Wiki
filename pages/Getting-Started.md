You may not know where to start.

## 1. The Flint Age
You can no longer break trees with your bare fists, so you'll have to get wood by creating flint tools. First, find some gravel. Gravel is commonly found near water sources or underwater. Dig it until you get flint. From there, left-click the flint on a stone block to break it into flint shards. Break leaves to acquire sticks, and then craft a flint knife using the flint shard and stick as shown below.<br><br>

You'll now want to craft a flint axe, but you must acquire some plant string first. Break grass to acquire plant fibers, and craft plant string as shown below. <br><br>

Now, combine the plant string, stick, and flint shard to craft a flint axe as shown below. You can now mine wood and proceed with normal gameplay.<br><br>

## 2. Managing Tough As Nails
You should notice a new temperature circle and thirst bar, which displays your temperature and thirst. You must manage your temperature to avoid hypothermia or hyperthermia and continually drink water to avo id dehydration.

### Managing Temperature
Your temperature will fluctuate based on your surrounding environment, including the biome, certain blocks, daylight cycles, weather, and whether or not you're in an enclosed area. You must maintain a neutral temperature to avoid screen tinting and damage from hypothermia or hyperthermia. To view these various factors in more detail, check out toughasnails.yml.

As a general rule of thumb, you should build your base in a temperate biome. Avoid hot and cold sources like lava pools or ice blocks. Most armor sets, when worn, will regulate temperature. However, the wool and jelled slime armor sets heat and cool the player, respectively.

Recommended gear in hot biomes includes jelled slime armor and a water bucket. Having a water bucket on hand allows you to submerge yourself if the temperature becomes too hot and quickly replenish your thirst. Soul campfires dramatically cool the player, making them useful for building in hot areas.

Recommended gear in cold biomes includes wool armor and campfires. Campfires (not the soul variants) dramatically warm the player, making them useful for building in cold areas.

### Managing Thirst
Your thirst bar will slowly deplete. You must stay hydrated to avoid losing sprint and health. You can replenish your thirst by drinking water from water source blocks, rain, water bottles, and juice bottles. To drink from source blocks, shift and right-click the water. To drink from rain, shift and left click while looking directly upwards. To drink from water and juice bottles, simply consume the item.
