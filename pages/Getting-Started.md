If you have just started using Realistic Survival, it may seem overwhelming or very complicated.
You may not know where to start.
If that sounds familiar then you have come to the right place!

This guide assumes that you have already installed Realistic Survival, otherwise start by reading [How to install Realistic Survival](https://github.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival/wiki/Installing-Realistic-Survival)

## 1. The Flint Age
You can no longer break trees with your bare fists, so you'll have to get wood by creating flint tools. First, find some gravel. Gravel is commonly found near water sources or underwater. Dig it until you get flint. From there, left-click the flint on a stone block to break it into flint shards. Break leaves to acquire sticks, and then craft a flint knife using the flint shard and stick as shown below.<br><br>

You'll now want to craft a flint axe, but you need to acquire some plant string first. Break grass to acquire plant fibers, and craft plant string as shown below. <br><br>

Now, combine the plant string, stick, and flint shard together to craft a flint axe as shown below. You can now mine wood, and proceed with normal gameplay.<br><br>

## 2. Managing Tough As Nails
You should notice a new temperature circle and thirst bar sitting above the vanilla hunger bar, which display your temperature and thirst. You will have to manage your temperature to avoid getting hypothermia or hyperthermia as well as continually drink water to avoid dehydration.

### Managing Temperature 
Your temperature will fluctuate based off your surrounding environment, including the biome, certain blocks, daylight cycles, weather, and whether or not you're in an enclosed area. To view these various factors in more detail, check out toughasnails.yml. 

As a general rule of thumb, you should build your base in a temperate biome and away from sources of heat or cold like lava or ice. Wearing armor helps regulate temperature with the exceptions being the wool and jelled slime armor sets, which only heat and cool the player respectively.

In hot biomes, you should wear jelled slime armor and carry a water bucket around. Having a water bucket on hand allows you to submerge yourself if the temperature becomes too hot and also allows you to quickly replenish thirst. Soul campfires dramatically cool the player, making them useful for building in hot areas.

In cold biomes, you should wear wool armor. Campfires (not soul) dramatically warm the player, making them useful for building in cold areas.

### Managing Thirst
Your thirst bar will slowly deplete. It is crucial you stay hydrated as you cannot sprint if your thirst drops below 3 bars and you will begin taking damage if it reaches 0 bars. You can replenish thirst by drinking water from water source blocks, rain, and from water and juice bottles. To drink from source blocks, shift and right click the water. To drink from rain, shift and left click while looking directly upwards. To drink from water and juice bottles, simply consume the item.
