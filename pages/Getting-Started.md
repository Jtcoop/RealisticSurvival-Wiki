If you have just started using Realistic Survival, it may seem complicated.
You may not know where to start.
If that sounds familiar, you have come to the right place!

This guide assumes that you have already installed Realistic Survival; otherwise, start by reading [How to install Realistic Survival](https://github.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival/wiki/Installing-Realistic-Survival)

## 1. The Flint Age
You can no longer break trees with your bare fists, so you'll have to get wood by creating flint tools. First, find some gravel. Gravel is commonly found near water sources or underwater. Dig it until you get flint.

![Gravel Block](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival-Wiki/master/images/gravel-block.png)

From there, left-click the flint on a stone block to break it into flint shards.

![Hitting Flint on Stone](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival-Wiki/master/images/hitting-flint-on-stone.png)

Break leaves to acquire sticks, and then craft a flint knife using the flint shard and stick as shown below.<br><br>

![Flint Knife Recipe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival-Wiki/master/images/flint-knife-recipe.png)

You'll now want to craft a flint axe, but you must acquire some plant string first. Break grass to acquire plant fibers, and craft plant string as shown below. <br><br>
![Plant String Recipe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival-Wiki/master/images/plant-string-recipe.png)

Now, combine the plant string, stick, and flint shard to craft a flint axe as shown below. You can now mine wooden logs.<br><br>
![Flint Axe Recipe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival-Wiki/master/images/flint-axe-recipe.png)

You'll notice that wooden planks are no longer craftable. Bummer, it seems like you've lost your ability to chop giant wooden cubes into planks with your bare hands.
Luckily, you can acquire wooden planks with the flint axe you just crafted.  
Place the wooden log down and right-click its top face while holding the flint axe in your main hand to acquire planks.
You may have to right-click multiple times.<br><br>
![Acquiring Planks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival-Wiki/master/images/acquiring-planks.png)

You should also notice that sticks cannot be crafted. To acquire them, place the wooden plank down and right-click its top face.
You may have to right-click multiple times.

These methods of acquiring wooden planks and sticks are not only annoying but also inefficient.
To get the full yield, craft a saw and then place the saw and logs/planks into the crafting grid to acquire planks/sticks.

## 2. Managing Tough As Nails
You should notice a new temperature circle and thirst bar in your HUD, which displays your temperature and thirst. You must manage your temperature to avoid hypothermia or hyperthermia and continually drink water to avoid dehydration.

### Managing Temperature
Your temperature will fluctuate based on your surrounding environment, including the biome, certain blocks, daylight cycles, weather, and whether or not you're in an enclosed area. 
You must maintain a neutral temperature to avoid screen tinting and damage from hypothermia or hyperthermia. 
To view these various factors in more detail, check out toughasnails.yml.

As a general rule of thumb, you should build your base in a temperate biome. Avoid hot and cold sources like lava pools or ice blocks. Most armor sets, when worn, will regulate temperature. However, the wool and jelled slime armor sets heat and cool the player, respectively.

Recommended gear in hot biomes includes jelled slime armor and a water bucket. Having a water bucket on hand allows you to submerge yourself if the temperature becomes too hot and quickly replenish your thirst. Soul campfires dramatically cool the player, making them useful for building in hot areas.

Recommended gear in cold biomes includes wool armor and campfires. Campfires (not the soul variants) dramatically warm the player, making them useful for building in cold areas.

### Managing Thirst
Your thirst bar will slowly deplete. You must stay hydrated to avoid losing sprint and health.<br>
You can replenish your thirst by drinking water from water source blocks, rain, water bottles, and juice bottles.<br>
However, you'll contract parasites

To drink from source blocks, shift and right-click the water.<br>
To drink from rain, shift and left click while looking directly upwards.<br>
To drink from water and juice bottles, simply consume the item.

## 3. Crafting Spartan Weapons
The vanilla Minecraft weapons, although decent overall, perform poorly in certain situations. To specialize your playing style and create unique combat strategies, you'll want
to acquire some [Spartan weapons](https://github.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival/wiki/Spartan-Weaponry).

To craft them, first create handles.<br>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival-Wiki/master/images/handle-leather-recipe.png" width="248" height="140" alt="Handle leather recipe"/>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival-Wiki/master/images/handle-wool-recipe.png" width="248" height="140" alt="Handle wool recipe"/><br><br>
Poles are needed for certain recipes. Their recipes are shown below.<br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival-Wiki/master/images/pole-string-recipe.png" width="248" height="140" alt="Pole string recipe"/>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival-Wiki/master/images/pole-leather-recipe.png" width="248" height="140" alt="Pole leather recipe"/>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival-Wiki/master/images/pole-wool-recipe.png" width="248" height="140" alt="Pole wool recipe"/><br>

Once you acquire handles and poles, you can begin crafting Spartan weapons. Spartan weapons are made from the same materials as their vanilla counterparts (wood, stone, iron, etc).
Detailed information on Spartan weapons, including their stats, can be found [here](https://github.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival/wiki/Spartan-Weaponry).

## 4. Getting Baubles
If you've explored and fought numerous mobs, you might have stumbled upon a rare material called spectral silt.  
Imbued with magical properties, spectral silt allows the player to craft powerful baubles.

To harness the power of a bauble, you'll have to equip it in a bauble bag. You can craft it as shown below.

![Bauble Bag Recipe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival-Wiki/master/images/bauble-bag-recipe.png)

To open the bauble bag, right-click while holding it. You should see a GUI like below.

Some baubles can only be equipped in certain slots while others can be equipped in any slot. This information will be indicated on their lore.

To equip a bauble, place it in its corresponding slot. All slots and some of their corresponding baubles are shown below for your reference.

|      **Slot**       |    Amulet     |      Belt      |      Body       |     Charm      |    Head    |         Ring         |
|:-------------------:|:-------------:|:--------------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|:----------:|:--------------------:|
|      **Icon**       |               |                |                 |                |            |                      |
 | **Example Baubles** | Wrath Pendant | None currently | Shield of Honor | None currently | Sunglasses | Potion Ring of Speed | 


## 5. Fighting Sea Serpents
Dangerous monsters known as sea serpents will now spawn in bodies of water. Upon death, they drop scales used to craft tide guardian armor.  

### Combat Strategies
It is recommended to have at least diamond armor, preferably enchanted, and a decent number of baubles before attempting to fight a sea serpent.
Since sea serpent attacks are most lethal at close range, players should use ranged weapons like boomerangs and longbows to safely damage the sea serpent.

Note that sea serpents currently do not have any custom attacks. Their AI and appearance are exactly like that of vanilla elder guardians, so any strategies used to defeat elder guardians will work for sea serpents.
This is subject to change in the future, however.

### Shiny Scales
You'll need shiny scales to craft tide guardian in addition to the sea serpent scales you just acquired.

They can be acquired by killing sirens. Note that sirens currently do not have any custom attacks. Their AI and appearance are exactly like that of vanilla guardians.  
Some users have reported that sirens do not spawn. If this issue occurs, you can edit the `MobDrops` section in the `iceandfire.yml` config file to add shiny scale drops. 

## 6. Slaying Dragons
The vanilla ender dragon has been replaced with a more formidable boss called the dragon. Dragons have three breeds, each of which are subdivided into four variants.

### Combat Strategies
It is recommended to have at least enchanted diamond armor, preferably netherite, and a completely filled bauble bag.
Dragons have the same attacks as ender dragons with the addition of two special ones, breath and explosion.
